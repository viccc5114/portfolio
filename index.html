        </div>
        <p class="project-description">
           All 3 of the icons are Chinese traditional instruments that I have learned when I was younger. The Icon on the left is called Pipa, it is a pear shaped body with 4 strings. The icon in the middle is called GuZheng, a very long body and with strings stretched across the body with some decorations surrounded. The icon on the right is called Hulusi, it has a ground-shaped look on the top and with 3 pipes extending from the ground - that’s how it creates different sounds. At first when I got this assignment I had no idea of what to do, I wanted to do something about table tennis but it was kind of given in the example so I had to give up. The reason that I created all my icons to be Chinese Traditional Instruments is because I thought that Chinese New Year is up to date and another reason is that I thought it was pretty meaningful to create something that represents my culture and I know how to play them all.So since my goal for this assignment is to make an emphasis on Chinese culture, I tried to pick as much “Chinese traditional elements” as I possible can and able to draw. I drew many plum blossom which in Chinese culture it conveys goodluck and peace, I also drew Nelumbo nucifera because I was thinking about some cultural landscape in Chinese I instantly thought of the West Lake (in Hangzhou) and the lotus flowers around it was very pretty, lotus flowers usually can use to convey as peace, harmonious, and unity. I also got some inspiration from xiaohongshu about some new year symbols that I drew on the top of my pipa and on the top left of my guzheng

          For this project I redesigned an HVAC engineering website to create a
          more modern, user-centered experience. I focused on improving visual
          hierarchy, readability, and navigation. The redesign introduces a
          clearer layout, stronger typography, and more consistent imagery so
          clients can quickly understand services, projects, and contact
          information. Content is reorganized into intuitive sections to make
          the site easier to scan and explore.The redesigned HVAC Engineering Inc. website presents a more modernized and user-centered experience where I tried my best to make the company look more professional in engineering. The old website was very text-heavy, visually outdated, and lacked consistency. My redesigned version have a clearer visual hierarchy, a more intuitive navigation, and a better colour palette to enhance the readability and user engagement. The new design focuses on simplicity and professionalism, the home page had a banner of “Building Smarter, Greener, and Safer Systems,” paired with image, where I wanted to spread trust to my clients because that will be the company’s value with company products in the background. The homepage also features a clean layout that highlights the company’s core values, “Experience, Expertise, and Efficiency” I have also added some stats (made up) by statistics (made up) like “20+ Years experience,” “350+ Projects,” and “$38.4M sales in 2024” to showcase a professionalism. I used consistent typography, spacing, and colour harmony to give the company a more professional corporate identity, I also have added many photos for all webpages to make the website look better and make users want to keep looking at the website.

        <p class="project-description">
          This is a project in GBDA 201, where me and my group have to film a documentary for a topic, the topic we chose was MBTI. Our documentary explores the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) and how it shapes the way people understand themselves and relate to others. Through surveys and interviews, we examine how the four letters help people understand their own emotions, behaviours, and relationships. We will also interview a psychology professor who offers a balanced perspective on MBTI’s usefulness and potential misconceptions. Ultimately, the film encourages self-acceptance and emphasizes that MBTI can reveal aspects of who we are but should never define or limit us; each person and MBTI type is unique! The purpose of the documentary is to show the power of 4 letters, they may describe you, but they’ll never define you. The theme is to explore how people use MBTI to understand their identity, including their emotions, personal strengths, and personality traits. The project also examines how individuals interpret their MBTI results and questions whether MBTI is a reliable psychological tool or a common misconception. I took a role as a main animator for this documentary, where I drew most of the animations for this video. I tried my best to keep it the same as our script for this video.
